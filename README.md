# Make CapsLock Great Again!!!
> Make CapsLock Great and Useful As It Should!!!

This project will transform the CapsLock key into a Hyper(✱) that can improve work and personal productivity thanks to its best ergonomic position next to the home row.
One thing that annoyed me as someone who switches between Windows and MacOS is the keyboard layout. 
This project will create a configuration that I can have almost identical experiences using MacOS and Windows, regardless of whether I use my small mechanical keyboard or the built-in keyboard on Macbook. 
## Highlights
- Transform `Capslock` into a powerful `Hyper` (✱)
- Quickly launch apps, useful navigation, window control, shortcuts, etc.
- Speed up productivity, high-frequency move stay in the home row.
- Work with existing modifiers: Ctrl, Shift, Win, and Alt work normally to avoid conflicts.
- Same finger position as Mac

## Requirements
- A mechanical keyboard:  to keep the finger position the same when using MacOS or Windows, the `Alt` and `Win` keys are swapped to replicate the `Opt` and `Cmd` keys on Mac, which I find more ergonomic when typing. For this matter, you will need a programmable keyboard to remap the keys. 
The rest of the keyboard will be the default ANSI layout.

## The CapsLock Layout
### Windows Setup
This project will focus on Windows, with the updated AutoHotkey V2 released in 2023. 

Below is the projected keyboard layout:

- when using `CapsLock` + `key`: activate the first option.

- when using  `CapsLock` + `Lwin`+`key`: trigger the second option.
